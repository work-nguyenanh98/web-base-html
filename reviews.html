I swore I'd never go back after the first time. Then I tasted it. Now we eat there least twice a month and crave it five more. The consommé and salsas are brilliant, too. Eat here.</p>

The meat was so tender and the tortillas weren't super greasy which is something I really dislike about some Birria taco places. They also give you some kind of creamy orange sauce/salsa situation that was so good. I will definitely be coming back here! Also I think 3 tacos for $12 is a great deal</p>

We got the Birria tacos and noodles and they were mind-blowingly good. Like, lick the drippings off the table good.  The manager is amazing too - loves what he does and couldn't be more gracious. Put this place on your list!</p>

Despite the limited menu, most if not all the items are great with a reasonable price. Small place with outside seating. I enjoyed my visit and will be coming back soon. Very satisfied</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Birria is in the Barrio. However, be warned, this is an acquired taste. We had pretty much one of every item on the menu minus 1 or 2 that were similar in style and flavor. The Birria Ramen, $8, is like a light caldo de res but, with birria. BUT, make sure you eat this HOT and not cold or Luke warm. The Birria Tacos (4) with consome, $10, a little pricey considering the size of the tacos and the amount of "birria" put in the tacos. The Keto Taco, meh, my wife ordered it and I don't believe it was that good. It seemed over cooked and almost "burned" in texture, if that is the way it is cooked, or over cooked. I had the Quesabirria Tacos with consome, $10, were ok, and as I said, probably an acquired taste. The Grilled Cheese, $8, was ok but, again, an acquired taste that my daughter wasn't not accustomed to. We'll probably come back to check out the rest.</p>
