Check photos this is what we got for onion rings and fries.  Completely burnt and covered in grease, grease is old and obviously has been over heated.  Don't waste your time or money here!</p>

It's just a tad spendy compared to regular fast food chains, but I still go every couple of months.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Great way to satisfy the In and Out itch! The strawberry shake was soo tasty and the size of it for the price was more than reasonable.  You can choose sweet potato fries or onion rings here. There is also a grilled cheese option! I think the most impressive part is the serpentine-method of traffic flow. We waited, and you likely will too...it's really goodand worth the surprisingly efficient wait. Pro tip: if you like tartar sauce, it's extra and advise prior to payment. Friendly staff, smiles abound, great food at a great price! Don't be frightened by the last of a restaurant! Stop in!</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">1st time here. Looks like prices have gone up since last photo, so I'll add a photo of new prices as of 5 Jan 2022. My son and I both had a double cheeseburgers and we ordered 1 side of sweet potato fries and one of onion rings, no drink. All for $20.  Neither of us could finish all the food. I think next time I'll split a side. The burgers were great, the onion rings had a very good batter and I liked the sweet potato fries, but they lacked salt (IMO). Service was fast and I'd definitely come again.  Side note, there is no seating, you have to take home or eat in the car.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Burgers, fries and milkshakes were delicious and very reasonably priced. Unfortunately the onion rings were a bit of a disappointment. They were the battered style and the batter was way too thick and unfortunately this made them soggy even though the outside was relatively crispy. I would stick with either the regular fries or Cagney's way fries which are fries covered in cheese and grilled onions. ðŸ˜‹  Not too much to say about the location itself, it's just a trailer in a gravel lot off S Meridian by the U-Haul rental/storage facility. You order on one side and pull around and pick up your food on the other side. We just parked in the gravel lot so we could eat our food while it was hot. Would highly recommend if you're looking for delicious burgers at a reasonable price!</p>

You must try it you will not be disappointed. Although it is a small place styled after a  food truck, does not in anyway suggest that it lacks in how to build a burger Try a malted to go with your meal for an extra special treat.

Fast, tasty and reasonably priced! And I don't have to drive 300 miles to enjoy it which is a huge bonus. Zero complaints here!</p>

Their onion rings are the best I have ever had and extremely affordable. They have huge shakes for a good price as well.  You will not regret eating here. We can feed 10 people for the price of feeding 2 or 3 anywhere else. They are actually cheaper than most fast food chains at this point, but with 3x the quality.</p>

Just the after smell of the oil from the fries stayed in my car and stunk so I had to go buy some air fresheners 3 vanilla trees for the smell to go away since having the windows down did not make the smell go away. Cheeseburgers were great. Will not go again because of the oil smell.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">I'll start with saying, I love cooking, watched cooking channels since I was little and I always get annoyed how most places can't make a classic good burger. This place NAILS it perfectly. The prices are amazing for the quality you get, a double cheeseburger was only $6 and is nice and filling. That's cheaper than a Big Mac from Mcdonalds and it's a million times better, not even in the same ballpark honestly. I had 2 double cheeseburgers, fries and a milkshake all for around $24 or so after tip, and it was all great, not a single thing to complain about with this place. Not to mention how they're put together with so much love and every bite was just perfect, do yourself a favor and try this place.</p>

The Holiday shakes are fun flavors and thick enough to dunk my fries. Definitely recommend them to my friends.</p>

                    <p class="mb-0">Is this the best burger on Meridian?  I think so! There are a couple great spots, but there is just something about Out & About Burgers.  This location has no seating and it's in a small trailer, but the food packs a punch. The burgers have so much flavor, and it's all cooked fresh. The ingredients taste high in quality. Luckily I live close so it's still hot by the time I get home. The fries are good and I get them smothered. The onion rings are so good as well! They also have fry sauce, like the close to Utah tasting fry sauce (IYKYK), so it's good!  The service is great as well, sometimes there is a wait, and I have seen the line of cars get backed up, but definitely worth it. I take all my friends and family there and I have never heard a complaint!  Now go get a burger!</p>

The prices are crazy good. $5 for a cheeseburger, $6 for a double. The food is absolutely comparable to In-N-Out. Maybe even a little better. Fries are fantastic. We were so excited I didn't get pictures. I'll update my review as soon as we make it back for more.</p>

The fries Cagneys way are everything IN N Outs fries should be, the burgers are perfectly cooked and well seasoned, the milkshakes are just the right consistency and generously sized. The quality of food is simply astonishing for a blink and you'll miss it type of place. I can honestly say this is the best burger I've had in Washington and for the price point I don't think there is a single spot in Puyallup that can compete.</p>
