### Best Practices

- Maintain consistent patterns across similar content types
- Group related content with common prefixes
- Use numbers for ordered or multiple items
- Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood

This template system ensures consistent, maintainable content management that can adapt to any business while maintaining clean separation between content data and HTML templates.
