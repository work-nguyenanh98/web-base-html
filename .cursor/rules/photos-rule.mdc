When updating the About page, follow these guidelines:


- **Title + Description SEO**: Update the `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, and `<meta name="keywords">` tags in the `<head>` to match the provided brand, about description, and keywords. Keywords should be generated based on the title and description if not explicitly provided.

- **Navbar**:  Update Brand name at [common.md](mdc:common.md)

- **Hero section**: Update the `<h1>`, and `<span>`  to match the title and about description, and keywords.

- **Photos Content Item Section **: Update the content in the main sections (e.g., "The Story Behind", "Our Food", "Our Space", "Our Promise") to reflect the new brand's story, food, and values, if provided.

## IMAGE OPTIMIZATION
- Check all `<img>` tags for missing or generic alt text
- Update all image alt attributes to be descriptive and match the SEO title
- Also update all `data-caption` attributes to match the new branding and content
- Ensure all `data-caption` text matches the context of the image and the brand
- Format: Change generic alt text to relevant descriptions based on page title/content

**Important:** Only change the content as specified. Do not alter the HTML structure, CSS, or JavaScript. Preserve all layout, style, and interactive elements (e.g., Swiper, Fancybox, scroll-to-top button).
